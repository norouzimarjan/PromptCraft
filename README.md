# PromptCraft

A powerful and user-friendly web-based image generator leveraging [Stable Diffusion 1.5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) and [Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0), built with ðŸ¤— Diffusers and Gradio for seamless, interactive prompt-to-image generation.

This app allows users to input a text prompt and generate beautiful images in various styles such as cyberpunk, watercolor, anime, and photo-realistic. It also supports customization through CFG scale and selectable image resolutions.

##  Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (for optimal performance)
- torch
- diffusers
- accelerate
- transformers
- gradio

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install diffusers accelerate transformers gradio
```

##  Example Prompts

- `a futuristic city skyline at night`
- `a cat wearing a space suit, cyberpunk style`
- `watercolor painting of a fantasy forest`
- `photo-realistic portrait of a young woman in the snow`
- `anime-style dragon flying over mountains`
---
##  Notes

- **CFG Scale** controls how strictly the model follows your text prompt. Values between `6` and `9` usually work best.
- **SDXL** produces higher-quality images but requires more GPU memory.
- For more detailed images, especially in SDXL, choose larger image sizes like `768x512`.
- The history panel on the right lets you keep track of previously generated images.
